# NoteCreator
This app let's a user create, edit and delete notes

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes
I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

This app still needs to get the routes set up and working to save the files, display them and save them.
